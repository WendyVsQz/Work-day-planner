## Pseudocode

# libraries to work with

- jQuery UI 
- Moment.js
- Google fonts

------------------------------------------------

# The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page


the color of the block change acording to the time

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

# step by step process

2. timeblocks> jQuery 
3. form> Bootstrap
4. color past, present and future> jQuery
