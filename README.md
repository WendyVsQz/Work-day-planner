## Work day Planner

This is a  work day calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.

# Functionality

    When the planner is openned, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    When scrolled down, the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours (from 9AM to 5PM)
    When the user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
       Past #94a736
       Present #ca231a
       Future  #471b8
    Then the user can click into a time block and enter an event
    When clicked on the save button on the right for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
    When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist
